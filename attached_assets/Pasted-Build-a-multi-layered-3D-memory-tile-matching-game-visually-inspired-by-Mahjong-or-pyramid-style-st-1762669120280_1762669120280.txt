Build a multi-layered 3D memory tile matching game, visually inspired by Mahjong or pyramid-style stacking puzzles.
The player must flip and match tiles layer by layer, progressing only when each layer is cleared.
The game should be interactive, animated, and visually appealing with smooth transitions.

🧱 1. Game Structure

The game board should consist of multiple layers of tiles, stacked one above another in a pyramid or tower formation.

Each layer should have a grid layout, smaller as the stack goes upward (e.g., bottom layer 6x6, above 4x4, etc.).

Tiles in the upper layers partially cover the ones below (like Mahjong or 3D stacking).

Layers should be rendered with slight 3D depth or shadow effects to make the hierarchy visually clear.

🧩 2. Tile Mechanics

Every tile must have a hidden state at the start of the game.

When a player clicks on a tile, it should flip with an animation to reveal an image (e.g., flower, fruit, shape, or symbol).

When two tiles are revealed:

If they match, both tiles disappear (fade or slide out).

If they don’t match, they flip back after a short delay.

Each tile image should have exactly one matching pair within its layer.

🔒 3. Layer Unlocking Logic

The player can only interact with the topmost visible layer at any given time.

Tiles from lower layers should remain inactive (non-clickable) until all tiles in the current layer are matched and removed.

Once the current layer is cleared:

The next layer becomes active and tiles from it are revealed as new playable elements.

A short transition animation or unlock effect should indicate progress.

📊 4. Scoring & Tracking

Include a counter to track how many tiles the player has flipped (moves count).

Optionally, display a timer that starts when the player flips the first tile.

Show stats at the end (e.g., total moves, time taken, layers cleared).

Optionally, assign bonus points for clearing layers quickly or matching tiles consecutively without mistakes.

🎨 5. Visual & UI Design

Use a bright, minimalistic color palette with soft shadows and clean UI elements.

Tiles should have:

Rounded edges

Subtle shadows for layering

Clear, colorful icons or illustrations

The layout should adjust dynamically for various screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

Add a background gradient or texture to make the layers stand out.

🧠 6. User Interface Components

Start Screen: Game title, “Start Game” button, and difficulty options (Easy / Medium / Hard).

HUD (Heads-Up Display):

Move counter

Timer

“Restart” button

“Layer progress” indicator (e.g., “Layer 2 of 5”)

End Screen: Congratulatory message with score summary and “Play Again” button.

🎬 7. Animation & Interaction

Smooth flip animation for tile reveal and hide.

Fade-out or pop animation for matched tiles.

Unlock animation when a new layer is activated (e.g., glowing effect or upward fade).

Include soft sound effects for flips, matches, and layer unlocks (optional but recommended).

⚙️ 8. Technical / Implementation Notes

You can implement this using any of the following:

Web (JavaScript / TypeScript) → Use React + Three.js or Pixi.js for 3D effects.

Python → Use Pygame or Godot (Python bindings).

Unity / Unreal Engine → For a full 3D version with tile physics.

Core Data Structure:

Store each layer as a 2D array of tiles.

Maintain a global state to track:

Active layer index

Matched tiles per layer

Total moves

Timer

Logic flow:

Start Game → Generate Layer 1 → Flip Tiles → Match Check → Remove Tiles → 
If Layer Cleared → Unlock Next Layer → Repeat → End when all layers cleared.

💡 Optional Enhancements

Add a “hint” feature that briefly highlights possible matches.

Include background music that changes as layers progress.

Add difficulty modes:

Easy: Fewer layers, fewer tiles per layer

Medium: More tiles and faster timer

Hard: Complex layout, more tile types

Allow save/load progress.

🏁 End Goal

A polished, layered, interactive memory puzzle game where players progress by matching all tiles in each layer, unlocking deeper levels, with visual satisfaction and increasing difficulty — blending the simplicity of a memory game with the strategy of Mahjong.
